I am a PhD student in [Dialogue Systems and Machine Learning group](https://www.cs.hhu.de/lehrstuehle-und-arbeitsgruppen/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html) at [Heinrich Heine University](https://www.hhu.de/) in Düsseldorf, Germany. I am supervised by Prof. Dr. [Milica Gašić](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning/our-team/team/cv-gasic.html) and I am supported by funds from the European Research Council (ERC) provided under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. STG2018_804636).

My research interest lies on user simulation, dialogue system and natural language understanding. In addition, I am also interested in reinforcement learning, adversarial learning, and other machine learning topics.
